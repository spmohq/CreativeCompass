I want to learn how to use ChatGPT to help me with my classwork, homework, and exam preparation in Geomatry

I am not an expert in ChatGPT, and I have no prior experience with online learning tools. However, I have heard that ChatGPT can support students in their studies.

I am a student of Class X, studying in a Bengali medium school, and I am not very fluent in English.

Could you please create a Task-Specific Course for me using the six key areas: Knowledge, Skills, Devices, Apps, Miscellaneous and the step-by-step walkthrough. Also, please provide its Table of Contents.

Please follow this special instruction carefully:

A Specific Task refers to an action that must be performed to achieve a particular goal. A course designed solely to teach this task is called a Task-Specific Course.
In contrast, a General or Non-Specific Task involves performing a variety of related tasks. A course that introduces these tasks without going into detailed, step-by-step methods—offering only an overview—is referred to as a Basic Foundation Course.
Please distinguish between Task-Specific and Basic Foundation Courses in your responses accordingly.

Absolutely! Below are the **most clear and effective prompts** for each of your two needs. These prompts are designed to guide ChatGPT to deliver structured, organized learning materials—ideal for your style and goals.

---

### ✅ **1. Prompt to Merge Both Courses into a Learning Roadmap**

**Prompt:**

I want to learn **Permutation and Combination** using ChatGPT, starting from the basics and moving toward mastery.

You have already created two types of courses for me:

1. A **Basic Foundation Course** (overview-level)
2. A **Task-Specific Course** (step-by-step mastery)

Could you please **combine both courses into a single, structured Learning Roadmap** that shows:

* What to study first (from the Basic Foundation Course)
* When and how to transition into the Task-Specific Course
* Key milestones or checkpoints
* The order of concepts to follow

Please keep the roadmap **clear, progressive, and student-friendly**, considering that I am a **Class X student** from a **Bengali medium school**, with **limited fluency in English** and no prior experience with ChatGPT or online learning.

Also, please continue to follow this special instruction:

> A **Specific Task** refers to an action that must be performed to achieve a particular goal. A course designed solely to teach this task is called a **Task-Specific Course**.
> In contrast, a **General** or **Non-Specific Task** involves performing a variety of related tasks. A course that introduces these tasks without going into detailed, step-by-step methods—offering only an overview—is referred to as a **Basic Foundation Course**.
> Please distinguish between **Task-Specific** and **Basic Foundation Courses** in your responses accordingly.

### ✅ **2. Prompt to Break Down a Course into a Weekly Study Plan (with Daily Plans)**

**Prompt:**

Could you please **break down the Task-Specific Course on Permutation and Combination** into a **weekly study plan** with **daily learning goals**?

Here’s what I want the plan to include:

* **How many weeks** it will take to complete
* **Weekly themes** or focus areas
* **Daily learning objectives**, examples, or activities
* A balance between theory, practice, and using ChatGPT effectively
* Lightweight and student-friendly pace (I study in **Class X**, Bengali medium, and I’m not very fluent in English)

This should help me follow a **disciplined, guided schedule** to master the topic step by step.

Please also continue to follow this special instruction:

> A **Specific Task** refers to an action that must be performed to achieve a particular goal. A course designed solely to teach this task is called a **Task-Specific Course**.
> In contrast, a **General** or **Non-Specific Task** involves performing a variety of related tasks. A course that introduces these tasks without going into detailed, step-by-step methods—offering only an overview—is referred to as a **Basic Foundation Course**.
> Please distinguish between **Task-Specific** and **Basic Foundation Courses** in your responses accordingly.
